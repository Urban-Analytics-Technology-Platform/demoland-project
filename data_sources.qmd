# Data Sources

## Comprehensive table

Indicators (columns) and plausible explanatory variables (rows - landuse variables)

| _Variables_ | Mobility emissions | Greenspace<br/> acc | Jobs acc | House<br/> prices |
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|n. of trips| X | | | |
| distance  | X | | | |
| mode      | X | | | |
| distance to greenspace |  | X |  | X |
| n. available jobs |  |  | X | X |
| distance to employment center |  |  | X | X |
| access to public transport |  |  | X | X |

... distinguish landuse as explanatory variable from landuse as indicator...<br/>
**VERY CONFUSING FOR ME!**

## List of sources

Data hunting still in progress, to be filled up when data use is certain.<br/>
