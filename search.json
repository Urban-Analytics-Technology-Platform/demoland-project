Distances from each postcode centroid along road networks to the nearest greenspace access point are calculated. Postcodes are matched to LSOAs and an average is taken to get an LSOA score (mean value).\nThe second greenspace indicator labelled as ‘passive’ is based on the proportion of greenspace within a 900 meter buffer (~15 mins walk) from where people live\n\nthe (assumed?) first version though uses OSM (like described above): Green, M. A., Daras, K., Davies, A., Barr, B. & Singleton, A. 2018. Developing an openly accessible multi-dimensional small area index of ‘Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards’ for Great Britain,  but is aware of OS, from the Appendix:\n\nThere were few open source alternatives (or data that could be shared openly within the terms of their licences) containing similar data during the construction of the indicators and our index. Since then, the Ordnance Survey (OS) have released an open resource of locations of green space (OS Green Space Layer; https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/greenspaces/) .

(limited number of variables) \\(\\rightarrow\\) ideally we’d like to perform this as well\nLUR output is raster VS vectorial \\(\\rightarrow\\) we’ll need to aggregate the data at some spatial level (MSOAs for instance), introducing some level of approximation\nnot clear how the spatial connotation enters the model, just because we use data defined at (some) geographic level? YES\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use_regression_model\n\nA raster graphic image of the area is generated and intersected with area-level population data to formulate the exposure distribution.\n\nHoek et al., 2008 “A review of land-use regression models to assess spatial variation of outdoor air pollution”  They review 25 land-use regression studies.\n\nApplication of the land-use regression approach for air pollution mapping was introduced in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations In Air quality and Health) study (Briggs et al., 1997). The technique was initially termed regression mapping\n\n\nLand-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)\n\n\nmain components of LUR: monitoring data, geographic predictors and model development and validation\n\nBertazzon et al., 2015 “Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling”\n\n\nLUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.\n\n\nMorley and Gulliber, 2018“A land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment”\n\nRLUR software to develop LUR model in R; Open-source code available in GitHub; GUI with visualisation tools\n\nMa et al. 2020 “PyLUR: efficient software for land use regression modelling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python”\n\n\nAlthough conceptually quite simple, its successful implementation requires detailed knowledge of the area, expertise in GIS, statistics, and programming skills, which makes this modelling approach relatively inaccessible to novice users.\n\n\nPyLUR out-performs RLUR for modelling in the Bradford and Auckland case studies examined. Furthermore, PyLUR is much more efficient in data processing and it has a capability to handle detailed GIS input data.\n\n\nThe principles of LUR modelling can be summarized in five steps. First, air pollution monitoring and GIS data are collected within the scope of the study area. Secondly, different kinds of potential predictor variables for each site are generated using GIS buffering or other geospatial analysis methods. Thirdly, multiple regression analysis is carried out to develop one regression equation establishing the relationship between the observed air pollutant concentrations and significant predictor variables selected from a pool of all potential predictor variables. Fourthly, model performance is evaluated using holdout or cross-validation. **Finally*, once the model is successfully validated, it can be applied to predict the concentration at un-sampled points of interest or generate an air pollutant concentration map of the whole study area (Morley and Gulliver, 2018).\n\n\nMolter and Lindley, 2021 “Developing land use regression models for environmental science research using the XLUR tool – More than a one-trick pony”\n\n\nA Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models\n\n… relevant for literature (it’s developed for ArcGIS, so no use)\n\n\n4.3.5 LUR in Python\n\ncheck out this blog How to Build a Regression Model in Python\nGeographic Data Science with Python, book Chap. 11, Spatial Regression\nPaper PyLUR: Efficient software for land use regression modeling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python  Note the code is available online on ResearchGate here (find “linked data” tab)\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Facts on GHG emissions\nGovernmental report UK local authority and regional greenhouse gas emissions national statistics, 2005 to 2020"

(Census, conversion factors, surveys…)\nwhen I calculate the distance home-place of work, how do I consider the intraMSOA trips (IE within the same MSOA), as I am only taking into account the centroids of the MSOAs?\nhow we count total number of people (age, people working)\ndo we give the results per capita (then see point above) or total per MSOA\nhow many hours for the working from home people (not counting for now, as not using transport)\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Approximations\n\nonly OD within MSOAs of this county\nconsidering as distance only the pop weighted centroids for each MSOA\nLondon has specific values for CO2 conversion factors (ex for cabs, buses, underground) but only using general values (correct later if needed for London case)\n…\n\n\nCommuting is really just one part of the total travels by car per per person per year:\n source: national travel survey\n… it sounds then reductive to consider only commuting trips for emissions!\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Python code\nNote: first trials in R, as I am more confident with the language, and trying to reproduce the code from carbun calculator for prep_travel_to_work.R,\nwill then translate to Python\n\nRemember to add in READ_ME a walkthrough.\nUsing env.yml \\(\\dots\\) use conda or poetry?\n\n\n\n4.4.5 Preliminary results\nOrigin Destination flows of individuals for commuting to work (2011 UK Census data), the Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear, separated by mode of transport \nPreliminary results for GHG emissions from cars, total per MSOA per year in Tyne and Wear"
