Indicator definition\n\nfor jobs accessibility\nfor green spaces accessibility\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Air quality index\nWe develop an air quality index as a composite of \\(PM_{2.5}\\), \\(PM_{10}\\), \\(NO_{2}\\) and \\(SO_{2}\\) particle values derived from the UK AIR project run by DEFRA with data available as a 1km grid (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data). The composite index follows the methodology of European Environmental Agency, reflecting the relative health risk associated to the exposure to particle intensities.\n\nThe bands are based on the relative risks associated to short-term exposure to PM2.5, O3 and NO2, as defined by the World Health Organization in its report on the Health Risks of Air Pollution in Europe project (HRAPIE project report).\nThe relative risk of exposure to PM2.5 is taken as basis for driving the index, specifically the increase in the risk of mortality per 10 µg/m3 increase in the daily mean concentration of PM2.5.\nAssuming linearity across the relative risks functions for O3 and NO2, we calculate the concentrations of these pollutants that pose an equivalent relative risk to a 10 µg/m3 increase in the daily mean of PM2.5.\nFor PM10 concentrations, a constant ratio between PM10 and PM2.5 of 1:2 is assumed, in line with the World Health Organization´s air quality guidelines for Europe.\nFor SO2, the bands reflect the limit values set under the EU Air Quality Directive.\n\nThe relationship between \\(PM_{2.5}\\) : \\(PM_{10}\\) : \\(NO_{2}\\) : \\(O_{3}\\) : \\(SO_{2}\\) is then equal to 1 : 2 : 4 : 5 : 10. The combined index can then be computed as \\[Q_{air} = \\frac{PM_{2.5}}{1} + \\frac{PM_{10}}{2} + \\frac{NO_{2}}{4} + \\frac{O_{3}}{5} + \\frac{SO_{2}}{10}\\]\nExcept for the \\(O_{3}\\), UK AIR reports all as a concentration in \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\). \\(O_{3}\\) is reported as a number of days above a threshold of 120 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\) and cannot be used in this formula but even EEA omits data when unavailable so we shall be able to create the index based on 4 remaning measurements.\nIt shall also be considered that UK AIR is not representing a direct measurements but a model.\nThe data from the 1km grid are spatially interpolated to Output Area geometry. The index itself is computed on the grid.\n\n\n4.1.3 House price\nAn optimal way of working with house prices in the modelling exercise like ours is to use price per sqm. However, those are not generally available at the level of Output Area or similar. Luckily, we can retrieve such data from the “A new attribute-linked residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019” project by Chi et al. available from 10.5255/UKDA-SN-854240. That contains individual house prices, total floor area and a resulting price per sqm resulting from a combination of Land Registry Price Paid Data and Domestic Energy Performance Certificates.\nWe use the data from years 2018-2019 and compute the mean price per sqm per output area. Given the data is not fully up-to-date, the modelling results will be presented as a percentual increase or decrease compared to the baseline value rather than in absolute values."

    "section": "4.2 Explanatory variables",
    "text": "4.2 Explanatory variables\nWe use a set of explanatory variables describing the environment that can be changed to model different scenarios and have, at the same time, explanatory power to predict our four indicators.\n\n4.2.1 ONS population estimates\nWe use the ONS population estimates on the OA level for mid-2020. The other data used in the project are generally reflecting the period 2018-2020, so we want to ensure we describe the compatible point in time. The dataset is retrieved from the ONS. Given it is reported on Output Area level, it can be simply joined.\n\n\n4.2.2 Workplace population by industry\nWorkplace population is coming from the Census 2011 and is reported on Workplace Zone geometries. We use the data preprocessed in the Urban Grammar project that aggregated industries into following groups:\n\nA, B, D, E. Agriculture, energy and water\nC. Manufacturing\nF. Construction\nG, I. Distribution, hotels and restaurants\nH, J. Transport and communication\nK, L, M, N. Financial, real estate, professional and administrative activities\nO,P,Q. Public administration, education and health\nR, S, T, U. Other\n\nThe data is then interpolated from Workplace Zones to Output Areas.\n\n\n4.2.3 CORINE Land Cover classification\nWe use CORINE Land Cover Classification for 2018 distributed as polygons of contiguous areas belonging to the same classs. We use the data extracted for the Great Britain within the Urban Grammar project and interpolate the data onto Output Areas capturing a proportion of each OA covered by each class. We further filter out fully or nearly invariant classes and use only:\n\nDiscontinuous urban fabric\nContinuous urban fabric\nNon-irrigated arable land\nIndustrial or commercial units\nGreen urban areas\nPastures\nSport and leisure facilities\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Urban morphometrics\nUrban morphometrics offers a way of describing physical built environment (buildings, streets) in a set of measurements capturing different aspects of morphological elements. We directly use the set measured within the Urban Grammar project, presented as individual characters (prior contextualisation) and interpolate their values from the original geometry (enclosed tessellation cells) to output areas. That way, we already get a contextual version using the project-specific aggregation to OA. This gives us 59 morphometric variables.\n\n\n4.2.5 Variable pruning\nGiven some of the explanatory variable were collected for a different purpose than modelling and with a different geographical extent in mind, it may happen that within our limited area of interest (Tyne and Wear), some of the variable are collinear. Those may negatively affect the performance of the predictive models and it is better to limit their number to minimum. We, therefore, measure Pearson’s correlation index and Spearman Rank correlation index between all pairs of explanatory variables and from each pair with the absolute value of the index above 0.8 retain only one, ideally the one that is more interpretable.\nThe final set contains 59 explanatory variables and the only morphometric were pruned down.\n\npopulation estimate\nA, B, D, E.

Dustin’s bus spotting website (bus spotting) \n\npersonal map on Felt with added transport network layer \n\n\n\n5.1.2 Jobs location\nWe have number of jobs as a datum down to LSOA level, it comes from nomis\n\nAn employer survey of the number of jobs held by employees broken down by full/part-time and detailed industry (5 digit SIC2007). The survey records a job at the location of an employees workplace. Available from country down to lower level super output area and Scottish datazone.\n\nFor destinations, when calculating the travel time matrix (TTM) to jobs locations, we can use then the population weighted centroids (PWC) of LSOAs areas. This assumption though affects the distances we calculate, in particular when considering vast industrial/business estates, where very few population is present - in this case in fact the PWC centroid will be probably (or could be) located in a marginal point of the polygon (IE LSOA area), resulting in invalid results.\nSee as an example the image below (created in Qgis) showing the Team Valley trading estate in Gateshead location\n Red dots = OA centroids (our origins)pink lines = LSOAs boundaries yellow dots = LSOAs centroids blue dots = WPS centroids\nLooking for alternatives, I have found a geography for the Census that takes into account the working population.\nWorkplace Zones (WPZ)\n\nWorkplace Zones are a small-area geography designed to contain a consistent number of workers allowing workplace statistics to be released at a more granular level.\n\nThe data available at this geographic level are here and they include the Workplace population (table WP101EW)\n\nThis dataset provides 2011 Census estimates of the workplace population in England and Wales by residence type (household or communal resident), by sex and by age. The estimates are as at census day, 27 March 2011.\n\nWe have decided to use the number of workers as a proxy for jobs count (STRONG ASSUMPTION). We can then use as destinations the WPZ centroids, and as n. of jobs (opportunities) the working population for the WPZ. A stronger variable could be generated using the location from the WPZ (destination), and as opportunities a interpolation from the LSOA jobs count to the WPZ areas. Note that the relation between Output Areas and WPZ is that “in England and Wales they [WPS] are designed to align with Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs)”.\nConclusions: In any case we need to make an approximation: using LSOA we give up on location, using WPZ we give up on actual (estimated?) job count.\nThe ideal situation would be to have the number of jobs and their location / employment centres. A way to deal with the lack of data on this, could be to generate it using Free Company Data Product\n\ndownloadable data snapshot containing basic company data of live companies on the register\n\nFrom this data set we can get number of companies registered at postcode level (see data fields here) which is quite detailed, and then find a way to aggregate/interpolate them to identify “job centres”. We have postcodes centroids from geoportal-gov.\nAs a future improvement, keep in mind the idea to generate more precise job locations, either by using the House company data, or other sources (and ideas)."

In this case we will need to find another procedure to generate a modelisation. We will then have 2 different procedures to generate the indicators, depending on the type of indicator. Within these two types, we aim at generating anyways a comprehensive methodology accross indicators to assess/analyse the different scenarios.A certain scenario can in fact affect different indicators, for example removing a green area to add a working compound can impact positively jobs accessibility, lowering greenspace accessibility.\n\n\n5.5.1 Project name\nA good name for the project?

Distances from each postcode centroid along road networks to the nearest greenspace access point are calculated. Postcodes are matched to LSOAs and an average is taken to get an LSOA score (mean value).\nThe second greenspace indicator labelled as ‘passive’ is based on the proportion of greenspace within a 900 meter buffer (~15 mins walk) from where people live\n\nthe (assumed?) first version though uses OSM (like described above): Green, M. A., Daras, K., Davies, A., Barr, B. & Singleton, A. 2018. Developing an openly accessible multi-dimensional small area index of ‘Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards’ for Great Britain,  but is aware of OS, from the Appendix:\n\nThere were few open source alternatives (or data that could be shared openly within the terms of their licences) containing similar data during the construction of the indicators and our index. Since then, the Ordnance Survey (OS) have released an open resource of locations of green space (OS Green Space Layer; https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/greenspaces/) .

(limited number of variables) \\(\\rightarrow\\) ideally we’d like to perform this as well\nLUR output is raster VS vectorial \\(\\rightarrow\\) we’ll need to aggregate the data at some spatial level (MSOAs for instance), introducing some level of approximation\nnot clear how the spatial connotation enters the model, just because we use data defined at (some) geographic level? YES\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use_regression_model\n\nA raster graphic image of the area is generated and intersected with area-level population data to formulate the exposure distribution.\n\nHoek et al., 2008 “A review of land-use regression models to assess spatial variation of outdoor air pollution”  They review 25 land-use regression studies.\n\nApplication of the land-use regression approach for air pollution mapping was introduced in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations In Air quality and Health) study (Briggs et al., 1997). The technique was initially termed regression mapping\n\n\nLand-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)\n\n\nmain components of LUR: monitoring data, geographic predictors and model development and validation\n\nBertazzon et al., 2015 “Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling”\n\n\nLUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.\n\n\nMorley and Gulliber, 2018“A land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment”\n\nRLUR software to develop LUR model in R; Open-source code available in GitHub; GUI with visualisation tools\n\nMa et al. 2020 “PyLUR: efficient software for land use regression modelling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python”\n\n\nAlthough conceptually quite simple, its successful implementation requires detailed knowledge of the area, expertise in GIS, statistics, and programming skills, which makes this modelling approach relatively inaccessible to novice users.\n\n\nPyLUR out-performs RLUR for modelling in the Bradford and Auckland case studies examined. Furthermore, PyLUR is much more efficient in data processing and it has a capability to handle detailed GIS input data.\n\n\nThe principles of LUR modelling can be summarized in five steps. First, air pollution monitoring and GIS data are collected within the scope of the study area. Secondly, different kinds of potential predictor variables for each site are generated using GIS buffering or other geospatial analysis methods. Thirdly, multiple regression analysis is carried out to develop one regression equation establishing the relationship between the observed air pollutant concentrations and significant predictor variables selected from a pool of all potential predictor variables. Fourthly, model performance is evaluated using holdout or cross-validation. **Finally*, once the model is successfully validated, it can be applied to predict the concentration at un-sampled points of interest or generate an air pollutant concentration map of the whole study area (Morley and Gulliver, 2018).\n\n\nMolter and Lindley, 2021 “Developing land use regression models for environmental science research using the XLUR tool – More than a one-trick pony”\n\n\nA Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models\n\n… relevant for literature (it’s developed for ArcGIS, so no use)\n\n\n5.5.5 LUR in Python\n\ncheck out this blog How to Build a Regression Model in Python\nGeographic Data Science with Python, book Chap. 11, Spatial Regression\nPaper PyLUR: Efficient software for land use regression modeling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python  Note the code is available online on ResearchGate here (find “linked data” tab)\n\n\n\n5.5.6 Facts on GHG emissions\nGovernmental report UK local authority and regional greenhouse gas emissions national statistics, 2005 to 2020"

Could we train the computer to predict these values?\nResolution LSOAS/ MSOAS ? feedback from Dani regarding SS: SS gives conversion to LSOAs \\(\\Downarrow\\)\nhow to generate scenarios - ideas: change parameters’ range/values, run ABstreet simulations…?\nintegrate with SPC - need to integrate more Census variables? feasible?\nUse SPC (individuals’ level data) as we aggregate at MSOA level… what variables are meaningful when aggregated?\ncan we actually build a methodology, given the different range of indicators and data?\nhow turn on/off scenarios in the visualisation- different layers in the map\ntype of output - map, web … MapBox MapLibre GL, Leaflet, …\n\n\n\n5.8.1 Output / map generation\nNote: could generate a website via MapLibre, checked the options"
