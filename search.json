Distances from each postcode centroid along road networks to the nearest greenspace access point are calculated. Postcodes are matched to LSOAs and an average is taken to get an LSOA score (mean value).\nThe second greenspace indicator labelled as ‘passive’ is based on the proportion of greenspace within a 900 meter buffer (~15 mins walk) from where people live\n\nthe (assumed?) first version though uses OSM (like described above): Green, M. A., Daras, K., Davies, A., Barr, B. & Singleton, A. 2018. Developing an openly accessible multi-dimensional small area index of ‘Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards’ for Great Britain,  but is aware of OS, from the Appendix:\n\nThere were few open source alternatives (or data that could be shared openly within the terms of their licences) containing similar data during the construction of the indicators and our index. Since then, the Ordnance Survey (OS) have released an open resource of locations of green space (OS Green Space Layer; https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/greenspaces/) . We are currently undertaking a full comparison of OSM and OS to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each data source with the aim of improving our green space metrics, however such an evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n• They use Routino open source software https://www.routino.org to identify the shortest path between two locations using the OSM transport network\n\nmeasured the network distance between the population-weighted centroid of each postcode in the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) and the coordinates of the nearest service (e.g. a population-weighted centroid of postcode for off-license)\n\ncode here\nConclusions:\n\nnot enough METADATA to be able to understand what to use (missing field names)\nnot clear which data source they use in which version (NDVI, OS, OSM?)\nonly passive accessibility available in last version\n\nWRITE TO THE TEAM detailed list of questions\n\n\n\n2.b.

House prices\nIndicator: house price (avg / zonal effect / dimension / amenities ???)\nPredictive variables: dwellings availability, services, accessibility to PT\n\nwhat scenario on house prices?\ngov.uk data most recent source: House price statistics for small areas in England and Wales: year ending March 2022\n\nDifferences to other house price statistics:\n\nThere are two sets of official statistics for house prices. In addition to these HPSSAs, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also produces the UK House Price Index (UK HPI). The HPSSAs measure the number of property transactions and the price paid for properties sold in a given period, while the UK HPI measures the changing value of properties in the housing market. You can find out more about the differences and uses of these outputs in our House price statistics for small areas Quality and Methodology Information (QMI).\n\n\navailable at MSOA level:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset No.\nDataset Name\nPeriodicity\n\n\n\n\nHPSSA dataset 1\nNumber of sales of residential properties for middle layer super output areas\nQuarterly\n\n\nHPSSA dataset 2\nMedian price paid for middle layer super output areas\nQuarterly\n\n\nHPSSA dataset 3\nMean house prices for middle layer super output areas\nQuarterly\n\n\nHPSSA dataset 4\nLower quartile house prices for middle layer super output areas\nAnnually\n\n\nHPSSA dataset 5\nTenth percentile house prices for middle layer super output areas\nQuarterly\n\n\n\n\n5.5.2.1 Accessibility data\nUPDATE\nIt seems that from 2014 the same type of data is released as Journeytime Statistics\nwith the list of tables available here\nNEED TO CHECK if they give also number of people, that seems missing in the new data format. For example the variable:\n\n\n\nAll20_PT/walk\nEMPLO049\nUsers within 20 minutes by PT/walk\n\n\n\ndoes not appear in the new tables, though, we have the total population (Empl_pop) AND the percentage of population per each mode of transport + time, for example (for table 0501):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nAlternate name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n100EmpPT15pct\nEmp106\n% users within 15 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT30pct\nEmp107\n% users within 30 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT45pct\nEmp108\n% users within 45 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT60pct\nEmp109\n% users within 60 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n\n… from which we could infer the variable above? \n\nSome useful and valuable datasets on accessibility by several means of transport was (apparently?) available from DFT until 2012, in csv format. After some strenuous research managed to find the archive for it here.\nAccessibility Destination Datasets\n\nthey measure accessibility to key services like:\n\nfood stores\neducation\nhealth care\ntown centres\nemployment centres\n\npublished for England at national, regional, LAD and LSOA level.\nhave they been substited by Journey time statistics data?\n\nNote data at LSOA level is also available in gov.uk in xls format\nwhere also 2013 is included!\n\nExcel datasets containing raw destination data for calculating Accessibility statistics. This gives the locations of the different services used within these calculations: Primary schools, Secondary Schools, Further Education, Hospitals, GPs, Town Centres, Employment Centres\n\nthese makes up to 8 tables of accessibility:\n\nscreenshot (from gov.uk webpage) of some of the the available tables\nAccessibility Statistics Guidance 2014\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Theoretical framework\nIn a general (non-linear/linear) regression model we have a given dependent variable which we try to explain by several independent/explanatory variables.  In our case for a LUR model we have, considering for example GHG emissions from mobility or housing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable\nactual data for GHG emissions\n\n\n\nExplanatory variables\nlanduse variables\n(ex. n. of trips, distance,  mode of transport…)\n\n\n\n\nFormulas here \n\n\n\n5.5.4 Some literature on LUR\nQuestions\n\nLUR is generally used for air quality prediction  …FIND examples of non-air pollutants applications?\nLUR potential predictor variables extraction … relevant for us? (limited number of variables) \\(\\rightarrow\\) ideally we’d like to perform this as well\nLUR output is raster VS vectorial \\(\\rightarrow\\) we’ll need to aggregate the data at some spatial level (MSOAs for instance), introducing some level of approximation\nnot clear how the spatial connotation enters the model, just because we use data defined at (some) geographic level? YES\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use_regression_model\n\nA raster graphic image of the area is generated and intersected with area-level population data to formulate the exposure distribution.\n\nHoek et al., 2008 “A review of land-use regression models to assess spatial variation of outdoor air pollution”  They review 25 land-use regression studies.\n\nApplication of the land-use regression approach for air pollution mapping was introduced in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations In Air quality and Health) study (Briggs et al., 1997). The technique was initially termed regression mapping\n\n\nLand-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)\n\n\nmain components of LUR: monitoring data, geographic predictors and model development and validation\n\nBertazzon et al., 2015 “Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling”\n\n\nLUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.\n\n\nMorley and Gulliber, 2018“A land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment”\n\nRLUR software to develop LUR model in R; Open-source code available in GitHub; GUI with visualisation tools\n\nMa et al. 2020 “PyLUR: efficient software for land use regression modelling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python”\n\n\nAlthough conceptually quite simple, its successful implementation requires detailed knowledge of the area, expertise in GIS, statistics, and programming skills, which makes this modelling approach relatively inaccessible to novice users.\n\n\nPyLUR out-performs RLUR for modelling in the Bradford and Auckland case studies examined. Furthermore, PyLUR is much more efficient in data processing and it has a capability to handle detailed GIS input data.\n\n\nThe principles of LUR modelling can be summarized in five steps. First, air pollution monitoring and GIS data are collected within the scope of the study area. Secondly, different kinds of potential predictor variables for each site are generated using GIS buffering or other geospatial analysis methods. Thirdly, multiple regression analysis is carried out to develop one regression equation establishing the relationship between the observed air pollutant concentrations and significant predictor variables selected from a pool of all potential predictor variables. Fourthly, model performance is evaluated using holdout or cross-validation. **Finally*, once the model is successfully validated, it can be applied to predict the concentration at un-sampled points of interest or generate an air pollutant concentration map of the whole study area (Morley and Gulliver, 2018).\n\n\nMolter and Lindley, 2021 “Developing land use regression models for environmental science research using the XLUR tool – More than a one-trick pony”\n\n\nA Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models\n\n… relevant for literature (it’s developed for ArcGIS, so no use)\n\n\n5.5.5 LUR in Python\n\ncheck out this blog How to Build a Regression Model in Python\nGeographic Data Science with Python, book Chap. 11, Spatial Regression\nPaper PyLUR: Efficient software for land use regression modeling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python  Note the code is available online on ResearchGate here (find “linked data” tab)\n\n\n\n5.5.6 Facts on GHG emissions\nGovernmental report UK local authority and regional greenhouse gas emissions national statistics, 2005 to 2020"
