# Trying to build method to for one land use
# IE let'r try calculating per capita emissions due to travel 2 work (per MSOA)

# travel_to_work_emissions = distance * n of trips * emission factor per mode

# need to aggregate data at MSOA level...
#Â how maby people travel how far with which mean of transport?
