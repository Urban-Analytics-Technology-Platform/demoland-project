## Building Indicators

### Modelling / regression analysis

### Accessibility calculation

**1. Build time travel matrix (TTM)**

- get GTFS data
- get OSM data
- run OTP to build graph

... or alternative routing system (check)

- use OTP to generate TTM

... or `5r5` from [ipeagit](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.html)


**2. Run accessibility analysis**

- get land use data (ex location of jobs, healthcare, population) or "supply" or "opportunities"
     - procedure for greenspaces

- run `tracc` or `pysal/access` on the TTM

in R could use `accessibility` from [ipeagit](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/articles/accessibility.html)

> calculate active and passive accessibility levels using multiple accessibility metrics, such as cumulative opportunities (using either a travel cost cutoff or a travel cost interval), minimum travel cost to closest N number of activities, gravitational measures and different floating catchment area methods.
