## Building Indicators


### Accessibility calculation

**1. Build time travel matrix (TTM)**

- get GTFS data
- get OSM data
- run OTP to build graph

... or alternative routing system (check)

- use OTP/r5 to generate TTM

... see `r5r` from [ipeagit](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/reference/travel_time_matrix.html)<br/>
or `rpy5` [here](https://r5py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)


**2. Run accessibility analysis**

- get land use data (ex location of jobs, healthcare, population) or "supply" or "opportunities"
     - procedure for greenspaces

- run `tracc` or `pysal/access` pr `rpy5` on the TTM

in R could use `accessibility` from [ipeagit](https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/articles/accessibility.html)

> calculate active and passive accessibility levels using multiple accessibility metrics, such as cumulative opportunities (using either a travel cost cutoff or a travel cost interval), minimum travel cost to closest N number of activities, gravitational measures and different floating catchment area methods.

... still TBC

**3. Indicator definition**

a. for jobs accessiibility
b. for green spaces accessibility


### Air quality index

We develop an air quality index as a composite of $PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$, $NO_{2}$ and
$SO_{2}$ particle values derived from the UK AIR project run by DEFRA with data
available as a 1km grid (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data). The composite index
follows the methodology of European Environmental Agency, reflecting the relative health
risk associated to the exposure to particle intensities.

> The bands are based on the relative risks associated to short-term exposure to PM2.5, O3 and NO2, as defined by the World Health Organization in its report on the Health Risks of Air Pollution in Europe project (HRAPIE project report).
>
> The relative risk of exposure to PM2.5 is taken as basis for driving the index, specifically the increase in the risk of mortality per 10 µg/m3 increase in the daily mean concentration of PM2.5.
>
> Assuming linearity across the relative risks functions for O3 and NO2, we calculate the concentrations of these pollutants that pose an equivalent relative risk to a 10 µg/m3 increase in the daily mean of PM2.5.
>
> For PM10 concentrations, a constant ratio between PM10 and PM2.5 of 1:2 is assumed, in line with the World Health Organization´s air quality guidelines for Europe.
>
> For SO2, the bands reflect the limit values set under the EU Air Quality Directive.

The relationship between $PM_{2.5}$ : $PM_{10}$ : $NO_{2}$ : $O_{3}$ : $SO_{2}$ is then
equal to 1 : 2 : 4 : 5 : 10. The combined index can then be computed as
$$Q_{air} = \frac{PM_{2.5}}{1} + \frac{PM_{10}}{2} + \frac{NO_{2}}{4} + \frac{O_{3}}{5} + \frac{SO_{2}}{10}$$

Except for the $O_{3}$, UK AIR reports all as a concentration in
$\mu g \cdot m^{-3}$. $O_{3}$ is reported as a number of days above a threshold of
120 $\mu g \cdot m^{-3}$ and cannot be used in this formula but even EEA omits data when
unavailable so we shall be able to create the index based on 4 remaning measurements.

It shall also be condsidered that UK AIR is not representing a direct measurements but a model.

The data from the 1km grid are spatially interpolated to Output Area geometry. The index
itself is computed on the grid.

### House price

An optimal way of working with house prices in the modelling exercise like ours is to
use price per sqm. However, those are not generally available at the level of Output
Area or similar. Lucklily, we can retrieve such data from the "_A new attribute-linked
residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019_" project by Chi et
al. available from [10.5255/UKDA-SN-854240](https://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854240). That contains individual
house prices, total floor area and a resulting price per sqm resulting from a
combination of Land Registry Price Paid Data and Domestic Energy Performance Certificates.

We use the data from years 2018-2019 and compute the mean price per sqm per output area.
Given the data is not fully up-to-date, the modelling results will be presented as a
percentual incerease or decrease compared to the baseline value rather than in absolute
values.

## Explanatory variables

We use a set of explanatory variables describing the environment that are can be changed
to model different scenarios and have, at the same time, explanatory power to predict our
four indicators.

### ONS population estimates

We use the ONS population estimates on the OA level for mid-2020. The other data used in the project
are generally reflecting the period 2018-2020, so we want to ensure we describe the compatible point
in time. The dataset is retrieved from the [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/censusoutputareaestimatesinthenortheastregionofengland/mid2020sape23dt10d/sape23dt10dmid2020coaunformattedsyoaestimatesnortheast.xlsx). Given it is reported on Output Area level,
it can be simply joined.

### Workplace population by industry

Workplace population is coming from the Census 2011 and is reported on Workplace Zone geometries.
We use the data preprocessed in the Urban Grammar project that aggregated industries into
following groups:

- A, B, D, E. Agriculture, energy and water
- C. Manufacturing', 'F. Construction
- G, I. Distribution, hotels and restaurants
- H, J. Transport and communication
- K, L, M, N. Financial, real estate, professional and administrative activities
- O,P,Q. Public administration, education and health
- R, S, T, U. Other

The data is the interpolated from Workplace Zones to Output Areas.

### CORINE Land Cover classification

We use CORINE Land Cover Classification for 2018 distributed as polygons of contiguous areas
belonging to the same classs. We use the data extracted for the Great Britain within the
Urban Grammar project and interpolate the data onto Output Areas capturing a proportion of
each OA covered by each class. We further filter out fully or nearly invariant classes and use only:

- Discontinuous urban fabric
- Continuous urban fabric
- Non-irrigated arable land
- Industrial or commercial units
- Green urban areas
- Pastures
- Sport and leisure facilities

### Urban morphometrics

Urban morphometrics offers a way of describing physical built environment (buildings, streets)
in a set of measurements capturing different aspects of morphological elements. We directly
use the set measured within the Urban Grammar project
