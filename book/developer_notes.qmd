# Developer notes

This page contains notes for DemoLand developers.
You should not need to read this unless you are actively working on the codebase, or maintaining any of the associated systems.

## Azure Functions

The web app currently uses an API which is hosted as an [Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-python).
The code required to deploy this can be found on the [`azure-functions` branch of the engine repository](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/demoland-engine/tree/azure-functions).

To deploy a new version of the Azure function, make sure you are a member of the *"Land Use Indicator"* Azure subscription (the subscription ID is `86307bb0-6d16-4077-b1f7-939370d5289a`).
If you are not, get Dani to add you.

Then, follow these instructions:

1. Log in. This will open a browser window where you can log in with your Microsoft account.

        az login

1. Set your active subscription to the one above:

       az account set -s 86307bb0-6d16-4077-b1f7-939370d5289a

1. Install the Azure Functions Core Tools. The following Homebrew command works on macOS; for other operating systems, refer to [the Azure docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-python?tabs=macos%2Cbash%2Cazure-cli&pivots=python-mode-decorators#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)

       brew tap azure/functions
       brew install azure-functions-core-tools@4

1. Clone the `demoland-engine` repository (if you don't already have it), and `cd` to the top level of the `demoland-engine` repository.

1. To test the function locally, run:

       func start

   You should then be able to access the API at `http://localhost:7071/api/scenario`.
   For example, you can test it using the following command, which asks it to calculate the baseline indicators (an empty scenario means no changes relative to the baseline):

       curl http://localhost:7071/api/scenario -X POST -d "{\"scenario_json\": {}}" -v

1. To deploy it to Azure, run the following, which will take a few minutes:

       func azure functionapp publish demolandapi

   Test it with:

       curl https://demolandapi.azurewebsites.net/api/scenario -X POST -d "{\"scenario_json\": {}}" -v
