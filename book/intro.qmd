## Quality of life indicators

The project defies four measurable indicators that can be linked to quality of life.

- Air quality
- Green space accessibility
- House prices
- Jobs accessibility

The indicators are first modelled for a **baseline scenario**  reflecting the current land use in the study area. Indicators are modelled using a predictive regression models based on the _land use_ features will that used as explanatory variables and measured using the multimodal accessibility model. See the [Methodology](method.qmd) for details.<br/>

## Scenarios of development

Once the baseline is created, the project defines a number **scenarios** of future development (e.g. densification of city centre or land release in the green belt area) and asses the effect of those scenarios on the quality of life indicators.

See the chapter on [scenarios](scenarios.qmd) for details and the [interactive mapping tool](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/demoland-web/#10.05/54.94/-1.59) to explore the results.
