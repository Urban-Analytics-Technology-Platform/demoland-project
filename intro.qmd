## Indicators building

The indicators will be predicted for a **baseline scenario** using a regression/predictive model on several variables of interest, where several _land use_ features will be used as explanatory variables.<br/>
Once the baseline is created, **scenarios** can be built, for instance, as effects of targeted intervention on land use and (ultimately) through AI methods via ompitmisation algorithms.

The initial plan wants to make use of the following **data sources** (see below for each indicator what source is intended to be used)

---

*Suggested data sources:*

- *SPC* - Synthetic Population Catalyst [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/uatk-spc/)
- **SS** - Spatial Signature [website](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/great-britain/)
- <span style="color:DarkViolet">both</span>
<!-- - $\textcolor{red}{\text{both}}$ -->

Indicators are grouped in 4 general themes to reflect the goals of the National Land Development Programme (NLDP) in relation to the environment, economy, infrastructure and society:

###  Net-zero
a. *Mobility-based emissions (e.g., trips x distance x mode â€”> CO<sub>2</sub>)*
b. *Housing-based emissions (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from building energy consumption)*
c. **Green space (area, access, fragmentation)**

### Economy

a.	<span style="color:DarkViolet">Distance to nearest job (by industry)</span>
b.	<span style="color:DarkViolet">Job volume within accessible distance</span>
c.	**Availability of (appropriate) housing stock**

### Infrastructure stock (vacancy)
a.	**Brownfield areas**
b.	**Vacant lots and properties**
c.	**Transport networks and connectivity**

### Society and Health 
a.	*Physical health*
b.	*Mental health*
c.	*Healthy living and lifestyles*


The data hunting is still in progress, see (Issues)[https://github.com/ciupava/LandUseDemonstrator/issues] in the GitHub page, [Notes](notes.qmd) and [Data Sources](data_sources.qmd) to follow the latest developments.


## Time plan

**To be defined**

6 months project ... roughly:

- literature collection

- data collection

- base scenario building (interaction with stakeholders)

- scenarios building (input from stakeholders)

- AI scenario builder tool development

- publication / visualisation / distribution

<!-- **Objective**

Develop modelling system to quantify features of land use in urban environment

**Output**

Landcover map for several metro in UK (sample: NewCastle upon Tyne?)

**How**

Creating *indicators* to build a *baseline*  and *future scenarios* -->
