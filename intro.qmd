## Suggested indicators

The initial plan wants to make use of the following data sources (see below for each indicator what source is intended to be used)

---
*Suggested data sources:*
- *SPC* - Synthetic Population Catalyst [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/uatk-spc/)
- **SS** - Spatial Signature [website](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/great-britain/)
- <span style="color:DarkViolet">both</span>
<!-- - $\textcolor{red}{\text{both}}$ -->

Indicators are grouped in 4 general themes to reflect the goals of the National Land Development Programme (NLDP) in relation to the environment, economy, infrastructure and society

###  Net-zero
a. *Mobility-based emissions (e.g., trips x distance x mode â€”> CO<sub>2</sub>)*
b. *Housing-based emissions (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from building energy consumption)*
c. **Green space (area, access, fragmentation)**

### Economy

a.	<span style="color:DarkViolet">Distance to nearest job (by industry)</span>
b.	<span style="color:DarkViolet">Job volume within accessible distance</span>
c.	**Availability of (appropriate) housing stock**

### Infrastructure stock (vacancy)
a.	**Brownfield areas**
b.	**Vacant lots and properties**
c.	**Transport networks and connectivity**

### Society and Health 
a.	*Physical health*
b.	*Mental health*
c.	*Healthy living and lifestyles*

## Data sources

The actual use of the data is currently still under discussion, see [Notes](notes.qmd) and [Data Sources](data_sources.qmd) to follow the current development.


## Time plan

**To be defined**

6 months project ... roughly:

- literature collection

- trials

- data analysis

- publication

<!-- **Objective**

Develop modelling system to quantify features of land use in urban environment

**Output**

Landcover map for several metro in UK (sample: NewCastle upon Tyne?)
