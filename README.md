# LandUseDemonstrator

Developing a modelling system to quantify features of land use in urban environments for the United Kingdom.

## Code

The research code is written in Python and is organised in the `code` folder in the individual Jupyter notebooks.

To reproduce the environment, you can use the `code/environment.yml` file with a specification for conda.

## Web app frontend

**https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/**

We have also created a web app, allowing users to visualise the outputs of the models and to compare the different scenarios we have chosen.
The underlying code for the web app is [hosted separately on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/demoland-web).

## Book

**https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-project/**

Separately, we provide a book which fully describes the project and its methodology.

To view the book locally, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and then run `quarto preview` from the root of the repository.
The source code can be found in the `/book` subdirectory.

The `/book` directory also contains a `notes.qmd` file, which charts the history of the project as it has evolved.
This is not included in the actual Quarto output; however, it is retained as a reference for anybody who would like to read it.
