DOI: 10.1038/s41597-019-0114-6\n\nFrom all the available types of ‘green’ spaces in the OSM data, we selected only areas tagged as public accessible with the following area types: cemetery, common, dog park, scrub, fell, forest, garden, greenfield, golf course, grass, grassland, heath, meadow, nature reserve, orchard, park, pitch, recreation ground, village green, vineyard and wood  … The green space indicator has been defined as an area measure of access to green space available to each postcode that intersect with a 900 meters buffer zone\n\nbut, from this 2019 publication, it looks like they are using the OS dataset (and giving both active and passive access):  Daras, K., Green, MA., Davies, A., Singleton, A., Barr, B. 2019. Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) - Updated version 2017. figshare. Short Technical Report. DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.8295842.v1\n\nOpen data from OS on Green spaces was used for preparing two variables related to the distance from the nearest green space (active) and the total green space areas available to each postcode in a range of a 900-meter buffer (passive) before creating LSOA level averages\n\nNote on Active and Passive Green Spaces\n\n‘active’ is based on the distance people have to travel to their nearest greenspace access point conducive to physical activity […] The measure is built up from analysis at the postcode level. Distances from each postcode centroid along road networks to the nearest greenspace access point are calculated. Postcodes are matched to LSOAs and an average is taken to get an LSOA score (mean value).\nThe second greenspace indicator labelled as ’ passive’ is based on the proportion of greenspace within a 900 meter buffer (~15 mins walk) from where people live\n\nthe (assumed?) first version though uses OSM (like described above): Green, M. A., Daras, K., Davies, A., Barr, B. & Singleton, A. 2018. Developing an openly accessible multi-dimensional small area index of ‘Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards’ for Great Britain,  but is aware of OS, from the Appendix:\n\nThere were few open source alternatives (or data that could be shared openly within the terms of their licences) containing similar data during the construction of the indicators and our index. Since then, the Ordnance Survey (OS) have released an open resource of locations of green space (OS Green Space Layer; https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/greenspaces/) . We are currently undertaking a full comparison of OSM and OS to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each data source with the aim of improving our green space metrics, however such an evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n• They use Routino open source software https://www.routino.org to identify the shortest path between two locations using the OSM transport network\n\nmeasured the network distance between the population-weighted centroid of each postcode in the National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) and the coordinates of the nearest service (e.g. a population-weighted centroid of postcode for off-license)\n\ncode here\n\nnot enough METADATA to be able to understand what to use\nprovaaaa\n\n\n\n\n2.b.

For example the variable:\n\n\n\nAll20_PT/walk\nEMPLO049\nUsers within 20 minutes by PT/walk\n\n\n\ndoes not appear in the new tables, though, we have the total population (Empl_pop) AND the percentage of population per each mode of transport + time, for example (for table 0501):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nAlternate name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n100EmpPT15pct\nEmp106\n% users within 15 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT30pct\nEmp107\n% users within 30 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT45pct\nEmp108\n% users within 45 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n100EmpPT60pct\nEmp109\n% users within 60 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk\n\n\n\n… from which we could infer the variable above? \n\n\nSome useful and valuable datasets on accessibility by several means of transport was (apparently?) available from DFT until 2012, in csv format.

The technique was initially termed regression mapping\n\n\nLand-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)\n\n\nmain components of LUR: monitoring data, geographic predictors and model development and validation\n\nBertazzon et al., 2015 “Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling”\n\n\nLUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.\n\n\nMorley and Gulliber, 2018“A land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment”\n\nRLUR software to develop LUR model in R; Open-source code available in GitHub; GUI with visualisation tools\n\nMa et al. 2020 “PyLUR: efficient software for land use regression modelling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python”\n\n\nAlthough conceptually quite simple, its successful implementation requires detailed knowledge of the area, expertise in GIS, statistics, and programming skills, which makes this modelling approach relatively inaccessible to novice users.\n\n\nPyLUR out-performs RLUR for modelling in the Bradford and Auckland case studies examined. Furthermore, PyLUR is much more efficient in data processing and it has a capability to handle detailed GIS input data.\n\n\nThe principles of LUR modelling can be summarized in five steps. First, air pollution monitoring and GIS data are collected within the scope of the study area. Secondly, different kinds of potential predictor variables for each site are generated using GIS buffering or other geospatial analysis methods. Thirdly, multiple regression analysis is carried out to develop one regression equation establishing the relationship between the observed air pollutant concentrations and significant predictor variables selected from a pool of all potential predictor variables. Fourthly, model performance is evaluated using holdout or cross-validation. **Finally*, once the model is successfully validated, it can be applied to predict the concentration at un-sampled points of interest or generate an air pollutant concentration map of the whole study area (Morley and Gulliver, 2018).\n\n\nMolter and Lindley, 2021 “Developing land use regression models for environmental science research using the XLUR tool – More than a one-trick pony”\n\n\nA Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models\n\n… relevant for literature (it’s developed for ArcGIS, so no use)\n\n\n4.1.3 Theoretical framework\nIn a general non-linear linear regression model we have a given dependent variable which we try to explain by several independent explanatory variables.
