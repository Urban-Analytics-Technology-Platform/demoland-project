House prices\n\nwhat scenario on house prices?\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Some literature on LUR\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use_regression_model\n\nA raster graphic image of the area is generated and intersected with area-level population data to formulate the exposure distribution.\n\nHoek et al., 2008 “A review of land-use regression models to assess spatial variation of outdoor air pollution”  They review 25 land-use regression studies.\n\nApplication of the land-use regression approach for air pollution mapping was introduced in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations In Air quality and Health) study (Briggs et al., 1997). The technique was initially termed regression mapping\n\n\nLand-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)\n\n\nmain components of LUR: monitoring data, geographic predictors and model development and validation\n\nBertazzon et al., 2015 “Accounting for spatial effects in land use regression for urban air pollution modeling”\n\n\nLUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.\n\n\nMorley and Gulliber, 2018“A land use regression variable generation, modelling and prediction tool for air pollution exposure assessment”\n\nRLUR software to develop LUR model in R; Open-source code available in GitHub; GUI with visualisation tools\n\nMa et al. 2020 “PyLUR: efficient software for land use regression modelling the spatial distribution of air pollutants using GDAL/OGR library in Python”\n\n\nAlthough conceptually quite simple, its successful implementation requires detailed knowledge of the area, expertise in GIS, statistics, and programming skills, which makes this modelling approach relatively inaccessible to novice users.\n\n\nPyLUR out-performs RLUR for modelling in the Bradford and Auckland case studies examined. Furthermore, PyLUR is much more efficient in data processing and it has a capability to handle detailed GIS input data.\n\n\nThe principles of LUR modelling can be summarized in five steps. First, air pollution monitoring and GIS data are collected within the scope of the study area. Secondly, different kinds of potential predictor variables for each site are generated using GIS buffering or other geospatial analysis methods. Thirdly, multiple regression analysis is carried out to develop one regression equation establishing the relationship between the observed air pollutant concentrations and significant predictor variables selected from a pool of all potential predictor variables. Fourthly, model performance is evaluated using holdout or cross-validation. **Finally*, once the model is successfully validated, it can be applied to predict the concentration at un-sampled points of interest or generate an air pollutant concentration map of the whole study area (Morley and Gulliver, 2018).\n\n\nMolter and Lindley, 2021 “Developing land use regression models for environmental science research using the XLUR tool – More than a one-trick pony”\n\n\nA Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models\n\n… relevant for literature (it’s developed for ArcGIS, so no use)\n\n\n4.1.3 Theoretical framework\nIn a general non-linear linear regression model we have a given dependent variable which we try to explain by several independent explanatory variables.
