# Notes

---

This page is constantly updated on an (almost) daily base, meaning that the order is not dictated by a specific structure, just temporary adding up ideas and development of the project.

NB: in reverse order, that is more recent stuff is at the top of the document.


## November

Need to fine-tune things after last talk with Dani (end of October).<br/>
Instead of trying to reproduce [carbon.place results](#did-someone-already-do-this), we want to produce a <mark>**Land Use regression model**</mark> $\rightarrow$ **LUR**

---

1. Generally used for air quality prediction <br/>
...FIND examples of non-air pollutants applications?

2. LUR potential predictor variables extraction ... relevant for us? (limited number of variables)
$\rightarrow$ _ideally we'd like to perform this as well_

3. LUR output is raster VS vectorial $\rightarrow$ _we'll need to aggregate the data at some spatial level (MSOAs for instance), introducing some level of approximation_

4. not clear how the _spatial_ connotation enter the model, just because we use data defined at (some) geographic level?

5. A <mark>**good name**</mark> for the project? (acronym)

### Variables creation

We are searching for data for the variables (land use features) to predict the 4 indicators (see Intro [here ](intro.qmd#indicators-building)) AND for the indicators as well:

--- 

_1.a/b_. **Pollution/emissions**

**Indicator:** *GHG emissions*

**Predictive variables:** *no. of trips, distance travelled, mode of transport*


- data for actual GHG emissions (total, IE comprehensive of mobility, housing, etc) is [only at LAD level](#data-availability)

- ...

---

_1.c_. **Green space accessibility**

**Indicator:** *Green space accessibility*

**Predictive variables:** *number of access points, areal extention of greenspaces, distance from greenspace (access point)*

Definition:

<blockquote> proportion of an urban population living within a certain distance from a green space boundary</blockquote><br/>
[Van Den Bosch et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26573907/)

- UGS = Urban Green Space

- see [Issue](https://github.com/ciupava/LandUseDemonstrator/issues/5) on GitHub for relevant literature on indicators, definitions, methodology to generate UGS maps

- accessibility is not actual data (like emissions for instance) but it's itself calculated as an index, so what is the meaning in modeling it?

- how we calculate the distance to the nearest green space... or the entrance gate (tricky)

- **EEA Urban Atlas** for UGS data (landcover map) [data available here](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-urban-atlas) <br/>
Download per each metro areas [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2018?tab=download)<br/>
Method described in [WHO Europe 2016 report](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/321971/Urban-green-spaces-and-health-review-evidence.pdf)
<blockquote>
**European Urban Atlas Class 1.4.1 (vector data code 14100):<br/>Green Urban Areas** (European Commission, 2011)<br/>
Minimum mapping resolution 0.25 ha, Minimum width: 10 m<br/>
*Included:*<br/>
• Public green areas for predominantly recreational use such as gardens, zoos, parks, castle parks.<br/>
• Suburban natural areas that have become and are managed as urban parks.<br/>
• Forests or green areas extending from the surroundings into urban areas are mapped as green urban areas when at least two sides are bordered by urban areas and structures, and traces of recreational use are visible.<br/>
*Not included:*<br/>
• Private gardens within housing areas<br/>
• Cemeteries<br/>
• Buildings within parks, such as castles or museums<br/>
• Patches of natural vegetation or agricultural areas enclosed by built‐up areas without being managed as green urban areas
</blockquote>

    Note that several green areas in Newcastle fall under the category "Pasture" (see for example Nuns Moor)
<blockquote>
    Lands that are permanently used (at least 5 years) for fodder production. Includes natural or sown herbaceous species, unimproved or lightly improved meadows and grazed or mechanically harvested meadows. Regular agriculture impact influences the natural development of natural herbaceous species composition.
</blockquote>
    and allotments fall into "Sports and leisure facilities"

        • VERSION 2 (2017) and VERSION 1 (2016)
        
        • here it seems they are using the OS dataset (note that apparently the older versions had both active and passive access to greenspaces: <br/>

_2.b_. **Jobs accessibility**

**Indicator:** *accessibility to jobs (measured/calculated)*

**Predictive variables:** *working population, n. of avaialble jobs*

- accessibility is not actual data (like emissions for instance) but it's itself calculated as an index, so what is the meaning in modeling it?
- QUANT [map](http://quant.casa.ucl.ac.uk/map2.aspx?v=JobAccessibilityObs)

_2.c_. **House prices**

**Indicator:** *house price (avg ... ???)*

**Predictive variables:** *dwellings availability, ...*

   - what scenario on house prices?

   - 


#### Accessibility data

<mark>**UPDATE**</mark>

It seems that from 2014 the same type of data is released as [Journeytime Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/journey-time-statistics-guidance)

with the list of tables available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/journey-time-statistics-data-tables-jts#user-access-to-key-services-by-journey-time-jts02)

NEED TO CHECK if they give also number of people, that seems missing in the new data format.<br/>
For example the variable:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
`All20_PT/walk` | EMPLO049 | Users within 20 minutes by PT/walk

does not appear in the new tables, though, we have the total population (`Empl_pop`) AND the percentage of population per each mode of transport + time, for example (for table 0501):<br/>


|Field|Alternate name|Description|
|-|-|-|
`100EmpPT15pct` | Emp106 | % users within 15 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk
`100EmpPT30pct` | Emp107 | % users within 30 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk
`100EmpPT45pct` | Emp108 | % users within 45 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk
`100EmpPT60pct` | Emp109 | % users within 60 minutes of employment centres with 100 to 499 jobs available by PT/walk

... from which we could infer the variable above?
<br/>

---

Some useful and valuable datasets on *accessibility* by several means of transport was (apparently?) available from DFT until 2012, in csv format.<br/>
After some strenuous research managed to find the archive for it [here](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20131223133629mp_/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240307/accessibility-statistics-2012.pdf).

**Accessibility Destination Datasets**

- they measure accessibility to key services like: 
    - food stores
    - education
    - health care
    - town centres
    - employment centres
- published for England at national, regional, LAD and LSOA level. 
- have they been substited by [Journey time statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/journey-time-statistics) data?

***Note*** data at LSOA level is also available in gov.uk [in xls format](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/acs05-travel-time-destination-and-origin-indicators-to-key-sites-and-services-by-lower-super-output-area-lsoa)

where also 2013 is included!

<blockquote>Excel datasets containing raw destination data for calculating Accessibility statistics. This gives the locations of the different services used within these calculations: Primary schools, Secondary Schools, Further Education, Hospitals, GPs, Town Centres, Employment Centres</blockquote>

these makes up to 8 tables of accessibility:

They review 25 land-use regression studies.<br/>
<blockquote>
Application of the land-use regression approach for air pollution mapping was introduced in the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations In Air quality and Health) study (Briggs et al., 1997).  The technique was initially termed regression mapping
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20–100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS)

<blockquote>
LUR models are described by standard regression equations. Over the past decade, land use regression (LUR) modeling has emerged as a preferred method for assessing exposure to spatially heterogeneous pollutants, including NO2 (Health Effects Institute, 2010). Despite their advantages, LUR models rely on spatial data; therefore, they are subject to the spatial effects associated with the properties of these data.

### Theoretical framework

In a general non-linear linear regression model we have a given dependent variable which we try to explain by several independent explanatory variables. <br/>
In our case for a LUR model we have, considering for example GHG emissions from mobility or housing:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| Dependent variable     | actual data for GHG emissions       | |
| Explanatory variables  | landuse variables |(ex. n. of trips, distance, <br> mode of transport...)  |

## October

**Initial trials**

Working on *a. mobility based emissions* $\rightarrow$ IE transport data

\&

Building *base scenario*

Roadmap:

- [X] Try to dl/open/visualise SPC data $\rightarrow$ *Note: study case Metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear*
- [ ] Investigate potentially relevant data from [UK Data Services](#people-behavior) data $\rightarrow$ any other relevant dataset?
- [ ] How to connect/integrate TUS to SPC dataset -- why?
- [ ] visualise the integrated dataset $\rightarrow$ *base scenario*
- [ ] think "future scenarios"

![](images/tynewear_county_lads.png)
*The 5 LADs in the Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear, highlighted are also the 4 major town areas*


---

**Keep in mind when you'll "generalise" the procedure**

*IE pass from the study case to a national case*

- how to select MSOAs for Origin and Destination from the dataset (take off abroad destinations as well)

- 

---

### Defining relations

We can see the Indicators $I_{i}$, with $i = \{1, ..., n\}$, as a function of different land uses $l_{j}$ where $j = \{1, ..., k\}$ and $I_{i}$ can be expressed as generic mathematical relation (that we express with the symbol "$\star$"") between several $l_{j}$ weighted by $k$ generic weights/parameters $w_{j}$, as follows:

$$I_{i}(l) = w_1^il_{1} \star  w_2^il_{2} \dots \star w_k^il_{k}$$

Different indicators can depend on same landuse variables, and per each indicator the scenarios can be expressed by acting on the paramters $w_{j}$.

As an example, using the definition above the indicator Mobility based emissions (a.) could be expressed **for commuting trips** <mark>per mode of transport</mark> and per each MSOA as:

<!-- $[\textit{emissions/ msoa / year}] = w_1[trips/day] \star w_2[distance/trip] \star w_3[n\_individuals] \star w_4[n\_commuting days/year] \star w_5[\textit{CO}_2 \textit{k}]$ -->

$$
\begin{align}
[\textit{emissions/msoa/year}] & =  w_1[trips/day] \star\\
& \star  w_2[distance/trip] \star\\
& \star  w_3[n\_individuals] \star\\
& \star  w_4[\textit{n of commuting days/year}] \star \\
& \star w_5[\textit{CO}_2 \textit{k}]
\end{align}
$$

where:

- $[trips/day]$ is a fixed value (average per person from DFT data ... *)
- $[distance/trip]$ is calculated as shortest distance between the MSOAs' centroids
- $[n\_individuals]$ is given by the UK Census 2011 commuting flow
- $[\textit{n of commuting days/year}]$ is a fixed value (average per person from DFT data ... *)
- $[CO_2 k]$ is the carbon dioxide equivalent emission factor per mode of transport

### Working questions:

- [ ] which year to take into consideration for the analysis? (Census, conversion factors, surveys...)

- [ ] when I calculate the distance home-place of work, how do I consider the intraMSOA trips (IE within the same MSOA), as I am only taking into account the centroids of the MSOAs?

- [ ] how we count total number of people (age, people working)

- [ ] do we give the results per capita (then see point above) or total per MSOA

- [ ] how many hours for the working from home people (not counting for now, as not using transport)

---

### Approximations

a. only OD within MSOAs of this county 

b. considering as distance only the pop weighted centroids for each MSOA

c. London has specific values for CO2 conversion factors (ex for cabs, buses, underground) but only using general values (correct later if needed for London case)

d. ...

---

Commuting is really just one part of the total travels by car per per person per year:

![](images/car_trips_per_person_travel_survey.png)
*source: [national travel  survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2020/national-travel-survey-2020)*

... it sounds then reductive to consider only commuting trips for emissions!

---

### Python code

**Note:** first trials in R, as I am more confident with the language, and trying to reproduce the code from carbun calculator for [prep_travel_to_work.R](https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/blob/master/R/prep_travel_to_work.R),

will then translate to Python

- Remember to add in *READ_ME* a walkthrough.

- Using `env.yml` $\dots$ *use `conda` or `poetry`?*



### Preliminary results

*Origin Destination flows of individuals for commuting to work (2011 UK Census data), the Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear, separated by mode of transport*
![](images/od_tynewear_bymode.png)

*Preliminary results for GHG emissions from cars, total per MSOA per year in Tyne and Wear*
![](images/results_tynewear_car_emis_prelim.png)



## September

**Exploratory phase**

The idea is to focus on a few indicators (one or two) in order generate a *methodology* to apply to different variables (IE all the rest of indicators)

Concentrating on Indicators for [Net-zero a and b](intro.qmd#net-zero):

- a. *mobility based emissions* ... integration with SPC $/$ AB-street?

- b. *housing based emissions*

cool project, GitHub code available but not reproducible (?)

opened issue here [https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6](https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6)




## Open general questions
*And plausible answer*


- [X] importance of localised emissions and need for air-flow modelling ... *not relevant for GHG*

- [X] what is the Research Question $\rightarrow$ *What are the "best" values in the parametrisation of the land use variables? Could we train the computer to predict these values?*

- [X] Resolution  ~~LSOAS/~~ *MSOAS* ? feedback from Dani regarding SS: *SS gives conversion to LSOAs* $\Downarrow$

- [X] how to generate scenarios - *ideas: change parameters' range/values, run ABstreet simulations...?*

- [X] integrate with SPC -  *need to integrate more Census variables? feasible?*

- [ ] Use SPC (individuals' level data) as we aggregate at MSOA level... what variables are meaningful when aggregated?

- [ ] can we actually build a methodology, given the different range of indicators and data?

- [ ] how turn on/off scenarios in the visualisation- *different layers in the map*

- [ ] type of output - *map, web ...* ~~MapBox~~ *MapLibre GL, Leaflet, ...*

### Output / map generation

Note: could generate a website via [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/), checked the options

<!-- Let's see if [this map link](map_again.html) works  -->

<!-- What about a nested map
