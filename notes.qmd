# Notes

## September

**Exploratory phase**

The idea is to focus on a few indicators (one or two) in order generate a *methodology* to apply to different variables (IE all the rest of indicators)

Concentrating on Indicators for [Net-zero a and b](intro.qmd#net-zero):

- a. *mobility based emissions* ... integration with SPC $/$ AB-street?

- b. *housing based emissions*



### Data availability

---

- Generated list of possible data sources with metadata, resolution, website (when available), etc (local on laptop, not online)

---

#### a. mobility based emissions
UK GHG emissions national statistics [Data for 2005 - 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-local-authority-and-regional-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-2005-to-2020)

- we can get from gov.uk CO<sub>2</sub>e (carbon dioxide equivalent) data for several occupations and travel modes, including transport, freight, etc [link](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/stacked-electricity-consumption-statistics-data)

- OD flows from UK census ... **only to work and home**? *check source*

---

#### b. housing based emissions
Sub-national electricity and gad consumption [Data for 2010 - 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/stacked-electricity-consumption-statistics-data)

(Experimental?) https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sub-national-gas-consumption-data

---

#### People behavior

People behavior and time use from *The UK Time Diary Study 2014 - 2015* - UK Time Use Survey carried by NatCen and available from [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/)

what we can get from this source: time people spend in different activities, mode of transport (yes?)

### Did someone already do this?

---

[carbon.place](https://www.carbon.place/)

Project from Malcom Morgan (Univ of Leeds) ...

> The PBCC estimates the average carbon footprint per person for each LSOA in England


**NOTE:**

cool project, GitHub code available but not reproducible (?)

opened issue here [https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6](https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6)




## October

**Initial trials**

Working on *a. mobility based emissions* -> IE transport data

\&

Building *base scenario*

- [ ] Try to dl/open/visualise SPC data $\rightarrow$ *Note: study case Metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear*
- [ ] Try to understand relevant data from [UK Data Services](#people-behavior) data  -> understand TUS data, any other relevant dataset?
- [ ] How to connect/integrate TUS to SPC dataset
- [ ] visualise the integrated dataset -> *base scenario*
- [ ] think "future scenarios"

![](tynewear_county_lads.png)
*The 5 LADs in the Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear, highlighted are also the 4 major town areas*

### Python code

- Remember to add in *READ_ME* a walkthrough.

- Using `env.yml`


### Defining relations

We can see the Indicators $I_{i}$, with $i = \{1, ..., n\}$, as a function of different land uses $l_{j}$ where $j = \{1, ..., k\}$ and $I_{i}$ can be expressed as generic relation $\star$ between several $l_{j}$ weighted by $k$ generic weights/parameters $w_{j}$, as follows:

$$I_{i}(l) = w_1^il_{1} \star  w_2^il_{2} \dots \star w_k^il_{k}$$

Different indicators can depend on same landuse variables, and per each indicator the scenarios can be expressed by acting on the paramters $w_{j}$.

As an example, using the definition above the indicator Mobility based emissions (a.) could be expressed as:

$\textit{mobility based emissions} = w_1trips \star w_2distance \dots \star w_3\textit{mode of transport}$

Is this useful??

## Open questions
*And plausible answer*

---

- [ ] what is the Research Question

- [X] Resolution - LSOAS/ MSOAS? *feedback from Dani regarding SS*
depending on how available data are aggregated

- [ ] type of output - *map, web ...* ~~MapBox~~ *MapLibre GL, Leaflet, ...*

- [ ] how to generate scenarios - *ideas: change parameters' range, run ABstreet simulations...?*

- [ ] how turn on/off scenarios in the visualisation- *different layers in the map*

- [X] integrate with SPC -  *need to integrate more Census variables? feasible?*

- [ ] can we actually build a methodology, given the different range of indicators and data?

- [X] importance of localised emissions and need for air-flow modelling ... *not relevant for GHG*

### Output / map generation

Note: could generate a website via [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/), checked the options

<!-- Let's see if [this map link](map_again.html) works  -->

<!-- What about a nested map
