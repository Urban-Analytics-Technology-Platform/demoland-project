# Notes

## September

**Exploratory phase**

The idea is to focus on a few indicators (one or two) in order generate a *methodology* to apply to different variables (IE all the rest of indicators)

Concentrating on Indicators for [Net-zero a and b](intro.qmd#net-zero):

- a. *mobility based emissions* ... integration with SPC $/$ AB-street?

OD flows from UK census


- b. *housing based emissions*



### Data availability

---

- Generated list of possible data sources with metadata, resolution, website (when available), etc (local on laptop not online)

we can get from gov CO<sub>2</sub>)e data for several activities (occupations) and travel modes

- a. *mobility based emissions*


- b. *housing based emissions*




### Did someone already do this?

---

[carbon.place](carbon.place)

Project from Malcom Morgan (Univ of Leeds) ...

> The PBCC estimates the average carbon footprint per person for each LSOA in England


**NOTE:**

cool project, GitHub code available but not reproducible (?)

opened issue here [https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6](https://github.com/creds2/CarbonCalculator/issues/6)


### Open questions

---

- [ ] Resolution - MSOAS? *feedback from Dani*

- [ ] type of output - *map, web ...*

- [ ] how turn on/off scenarios - *different layers*

- [ ] integrate with SPC -  need to integrate more Census variables? feasible?

- [ ] can we actually build a methodology, given the different range of indicators and data?

- [X] importance of localised emissions and need for air-flow modelling ... *not relevant for GHG*
